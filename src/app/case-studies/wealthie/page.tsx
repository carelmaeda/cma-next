                <p>The client reached out to me with a clear goal: to create a financial app for teenagers, powered by Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                <p>The app needed to be simple to use, intuitive, and leverage AI to help users manage their finances smarter.</p>

                <p>Finance apps can feel intimidating, especially for younger users who might not be familiar with investing or budgeting.</p>
                <p>The challenge was to design an app that made financial management easy, engaging, and actionable while also introducing A.I elements</p>

                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                <p>I designed and built Wealthie with a focus on simplicity, personalization, and AI-driven insights.</p>
                <p>Key Features & Design Decisions:</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li><strong>AI-Powered Financial Insights:</strong> Users could quickly sign up and start uploading receipts with minimal effort.</li>
                  <li><strong>Minimalist UI: </strong> A visual progress bar showed how close they were to earning their next reward.</li>
                  <li><strong>Gamified Savings Goals: </strong>Unlocking rewards felt satisfying and encouraged repeat participation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Conversational AI Assistant: </strong>Users could select from a variety of reward options, making the experience more appealing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dark Mode & Custom Themes: </strong>Recognizing the tech-savvy audience, I included customization options for a more personalized experience.</li>

                <h4>The UX Approach</h4>
                <p>These were my insights analyzing the users and the industry</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li><strong>User Research & Persona Development:</strong>I studied the behaviors of young adults when it comes to finance, identifying their pain points and goals.</li>
                  <li><strong>Iterative Design Process: </strong>Based on user feedback, I fine-tuned the app&apos;s features and interface to ensure clarity and engagement, the client also assisted with feedback</li>
                  <li><strong>Adding A.I:</strong>One of the feedback points was to make an A.I. screen easily accessible at all times for users, and it didn&rsquo;t need to be a full screen.</li>
                </ul>
                 <figure>
                 <p>Using this information I created a screen dedicated just for interactions with Wealthie&apos;s A.I.:</p>

              <div id="result">
                <h4>The Result</h4>
                <p>Wealthie provides an AI-driven, user-friendly financial experience designed for young adults.</p>
                <p>By making budgeting and investing approachable, the app empowers users to take control of their money without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

              <div id="conclusion">
                <h4>Conclusion and Takeways</h4>
              <p>Wealthie transformed financial planning into something intuitive and actionable. It&apos;s more than just an appâ€”it&apos;s a financial coach in your pocket.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>AI can make financial management easier, but the UX still needs to simplify complex concepts.</li>
                  <li>If you assign an engaging visual to a feature or a service, the user will find it easier to engage</li>
                  <li>A conversational, friendly approach makes finance apps feel less intimidating.</li>
                </ul>
